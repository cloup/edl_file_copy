EDL file copy utility
---------------------


This is a small utility script written in ruby to help unlucky cinematographers with little scripting knowledge. This script allows to parse an [edit list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_decision_list), a type of file widely used in film editing. It looks for file names and search the corresponding folder in the source directory, i.e. where the full resolution files reside. It then simply make a copy of that directory in the destination directory. You will get the destination directory just loaded with the full resolution files you need for conforming your film.

Be sure to edit the configuration file called 'config.txt'

Enjoy the time saved!
